PROCEDURE TO RUN THE FAST API:
## 1. Install FastAPI and a Web Server:
First, make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Install FastAPI using pip:
Copy code pip install fastapi Additionally, you'll need a web server. Uvicorn is a popular ASGI server recommended for FastAPI:
Copy code pip install uvicorn
## 2. Create a FastAPI Application:
Create a Python file (e.g., main.py) where you'll define your FastAPI application. 
## 3. Define Your API Endpoints:
Use FastAPI decorators like @app.get() or @app.post() to define your API endpoints. Define functions for each endpoint that specify the route, request parameters, request body, and response model.
## 4. Run the Application with Uvicorn:
Use the uvicorn command to run your FastAPI application:
css Copy code uvicorn main:app --reload Replace main with your Python file name (without the .py extension) and app with the name of your FastAPI application instance.
The --host and --port options specify the host and port on which your application will run.
The --reload option enables automatic code reloading during development.
## 5. Access Your API:
Once the application is running, you can access your API in a web browser or use tools like curl or Postman to make HTTP requests to the defined endpoints.
python Copy code from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()
@app.get("/") def read_root(): return {"message": "Hello, FastAPI!"} To run this application, save it in a file (e.g., main.py) and run:
bash Copy code uvicorn main:app --reload Your FastAPI application will be available at http://localhost:8000 by default. You can define more complex routes, request handling, and data models as needed for your specific API.
Hint: Try using the Anaconda prompt and save all these files in the same location.
